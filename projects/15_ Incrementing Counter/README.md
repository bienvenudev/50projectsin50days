## Overview

### The challenge

This project animates follower counters on a webpage, smoothly incrementing from 0 to a target number for each social media platform.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Font Awesome icons
- CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to leverage the data-target attribute to create dynamic and flexible animations.

Additionally, I used an invisible <h1> element with the class sr-only for accessibility purposes. This element provides structure and improves accessibility for screen readers without affecting the visual design.

```html
<div class="counter" data-target="12000"></div>
```

This code snippet utilizes the data-target attribute to store the target number for the counter animation. This allowed me to easily set different target values for each follower count without modifying the JavaScript logic itself.

### Continued development

I will continue to explore and implement more advanced techniques for animating and enhancing user interfaces. Additionally, I'll focus on improving accessibility standards in my projects.
