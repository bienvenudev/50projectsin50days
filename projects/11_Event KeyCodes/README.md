## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Get the key and key code when they press any key on the keyboard.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript (Ternary Operator)

### What I learned

I learned how to get the pressed key and its code from the keyboard. I also learned about ternary operators and how they can be a good substitute for if statements (in some cases).

```js
`<div id="key" class="key">${event.key == " " ? "Space" : event.key}</div>`;
```

### Continued development

I'll continue to learn more about conditional operators and their use.

### Useful resources

- [Javascript ternary operator.](https://javascript.info/logical-operators)
- [keydown event in Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keydown_event)
