## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to create an Animated Navigation where users can click the open/close button to show/hide the menu smoothly.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup for structuring the content.
- CSS Flexbox for layout and styling.
- CSS transitions (using transform and opacity) for smooth animations.
- JavaScript for adding interactivity to the navigation.

### What I learned

I learned how to utilize the CSS transition property to achieve smooth transitions and animations. Here's an example of CSS code:

```css
nav ul li {
  transition: transform 0.6s linear, opacity 0.6s linear;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue exploring and mastering animations in CSS, focusing on using transform and transition properties for more dynamic user experiences.
