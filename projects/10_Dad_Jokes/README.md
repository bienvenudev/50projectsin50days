### What I learned

In this project, I gained valuable insights into fetching APIs using different methods:

#### Using `.then()`

I learned how to fetch APIs using the get method and handle asynchronous operations with `.then()`.

Initially, I struggled to understand why we need to call `.then()` twice:

```js
fetch("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/", config)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => (jokeEl.innerText = data.joke));
```

#### Using `async/await` for cleaner asychronous code:

By labeling the function as async and using await inside it, The code becomes cleaner and easier to read compared to chaining multiple `.then()` calls.

```js
async function fetchJoke() {
  const response = await fetch("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/", config);
  const data = await response.json();
  jokeEl.innerText = data.joke;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable with fetching APIs and different methods of doing it, but I will continue using these methods to achieve it.
In this course, I was also introduced to the Postman API platform, and I'll check it out.
