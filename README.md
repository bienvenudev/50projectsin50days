# 50 projects in 50 days

Welcome to my journey of the "50 projects in 50 days" challenge! ðŸš€

[Find the project course here](https://50projects50days.com/)

# Overview

I'm taking on the exciting challenge of building 50 projects in 50 days. Although I haven't managed to complete a project daily, I'm committed to doing my best and learning as I progress.

# Learning and Progress

Each project in this challenge has taught me valuable lessons, and I've documented my learning in the README files starting from Project 10. Documenting my learning has been a great way to retain information and track my progress.

# Future Plans

I'll continue deploying projects as I advance through the challenge. You can check out my progress and explore the individual projects, each with its own README documenting what I've learned.
